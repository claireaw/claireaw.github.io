    <h1>Claire's Homepage</h1>
    My name is Claire, and this is my current homepage. I use it to showcase the projects I've been working on and some information about myself.

      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>I have a number of personal research interests I like learning about including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Semiconductors</li>
  <li>Lattice-based cryptography</li>
  <li>On-chip hardware security</li>
</ul> 
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Current Projects</h3>
    <p>This is a list of projects I am currently working on.</p>
    <h4>Java-based code scanning game Android application</h4>
Repository Not Available
    <p>An Android application built as a proof-of-concept for a physical game. The application will provide an interactable countdown clock alongside the game.</p>
    <h4>Plotly pie chart scatter plot overlay</h4>
<a href="https://github.com/claireaw/Plotly-Pie-Chart-Example">Repository</a>
      <p>Combining two aspects of the Plotly library, this project attempts to plot unique pie charts over individual scatter plot points.</p>
    <h3>Completed Projects</h3>
    <p>This is a list of projects I have completed, either for my personal study or for clients.</p>
    <h4>Tavern Keeper</h4>

      <a href="https://github.com/claireaw/Tavern_Keeper">Repository</a>
    <p>Tavern Keeper was a request for a Discord bot that simulated a fantasy virtual marketplace. Users are able to sign up, purchase items, and are given usable currency based on attendance.</p>
<p>The bot was written in Python and originally originally stocked with a MongoDB instance, but was later rewritten to utilize a MySQL instance on Amazon's Relational Database Service.</p>
    <h5>Tavern Keeper 2.0</h5>
      <img src="Files/Tavern%20Keeper%20gif.gif" alt="GIF demonstrating the capabilities of Tavern Keeper 2" width="250" height="200">
    <br>
<a href="https://github.com/claireaw/Tavern-Keeper-2">Repository</a> 
    <p>Tavern Keeper 2.0 was rewritten from the ground up, using an SQL database in an Amazon relational database. The speed of the bot's responses increased, in addition to adding a command function that automatically randomly restocks the marketplace from over 1500 possible items.</p>
    <h4>Gunbarrel Graphing Software</h4>

    <br>
Repository Not Available
    <p>The Gunbarrel Graphing software was a request for a piece of software that would take in a series of data points and could project them across a gunbarrel-style graph, alongside customizability options. I used Python and plotly to compose much of the logic behind the graph.</p>
    <h4>Lightning Rod</h4>
      <img src="Files/Lightning%20Rod%20demo.png" alt="Image showing a quick result from the Lightning Rod program" width="250" height="200">
    <br>
<a href="https://github.com/claireaw/Lightning_Rod">Repository</a>
    <p>Inspired by my playing of a Triton Storm Sorceror in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, Lightning Rod was a Python program used to test basic logic. It was built on the concept of casting a Lightning Bolt spell, and finding the optimal shooting configuration. The program takes in an Excel sheet map of its surroundings, and runs through scoring each of the eight possible directions, retuning the direction with the largest score.</p>
    <p>In the future, I aim to have this program account for the player's potential movement, as well as the introduction of Chain Lightning logic.</p>
