    <h1>Claire's Homepage</h1>
    This is my current homepage. I'll use it to some about the projects I've been working on.
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Current Projects</h3>
    <p>This is a list of projects I am currently working on.</p>
    <h3>Completed Projects</h3>
    <p>This is a list of projects I have completed, either for my personal study or for clients.</p>
    <h4>Tavern Keeper</h4>
    <p>Tavern Keeper was a request for a Discord bot that simulated a fantasy virtual marketplace. Users are able to sign up, purchase items, and are given usable currency based on attendance</p>
    <h4>Gunbarrel Graphing Software</h4>
    <p>The Gunbarrel Graphing software was a request for a software that would take in a series of items and could project them across a scatter graph, alongside customizability options. I used plotly to compose much of the logic behind the graph.</p>
    <h3>Future Projects</h3>
    <p>This is a list of projects I intend to work on.</p>
